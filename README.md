#Machine Learning repsitory

The following is a set of projects aimed at either data aggregation and trend analysis or data modelling using classification
models with Machince Learning. These projects are written in Python 2.7 using the ipython notebook for block by block execution
and analysis. 

The open source libraries SciKit Learn, Numpy, Pandas and Scipy have been used extensively for the projections. The sources of
the datasets have been included in the comments.
